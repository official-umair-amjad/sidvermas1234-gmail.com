| Criterion                                       | Score | Comments                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Requirement coverage                         | 4     | They include most of the required features: private chats, group chats, public channels, read/delivery history, attachments. But enforcement of certain business rules is weak. |
| 2. Modeling correctness & normalization         | 4     | Good use of junction tables, separate tables for statuses, attachment metadata. Some minor normalization or foreign key constraints unclear in places.                          |
| 3. Scalability & performance                    | 3     | They mention indexing, partitioning, read replicas, but not deeply. No explicit sharding or fan-out strategy.                                                                   |
| 4. Status & temporal events                     | 4     | They use `message_read`, `message_delivery_history`, separate tables. That’s proper. The semantics (e.g. multiple status transitions) seem supported.                           |
| 5. Security & multi-tenancy                     | 3     | They handle password hashing, some access control, but no row-level security, no discussion of signed URLs or fine-grained ACLs.                                                |
| 6. Files / multimedia handling                  | 3     | They separate attachments and store metadata; but they do not detail object store, versioning, streaming vs blob storage.                                                       |
| 7. Group membership semantics & history         | 3     | They have a `conversation_member` concept, but I couldn’t confirm “joined_at / left_at / kicked” fields or logic for message visibility before join.                            |
| 8. Public channels semantics                    | 3     | They model conversation type and membership, but the rules (everyone reads, only members post) are not strictly enforced in schema.                                             |
| 9. Operational considerations / maintainability | 2     | Little discussion of migrations, schema evolution, partition maintenance, zero downtime, backfill etc.                                                                          |
| 10. Clarity of notes & reasoning                | 4     | Their notes are understandable, the decisions are described, assumptions stated. But some parts are surface-level rather than deeply justified.                                 |


I looked at both notes.md and proposal.md. My impression:

The writing is relatively clean and clear, but there are small imperfections, uneven depth, and occasional generic phrasing. That is consistent with human writing with some help or reference to existing patterns.

There is no obvious “smell” of full AI generation (e.g. overuse of very formal phrasing, repetitive structure, unusual phrasing). The content is specific to the assignment, uses domain-specific terms, and exhibits minor idiosyncrasies in expression.

Some paragraphs are quite general and could be templates, but overall, the documents seem plausible as human work, perhaps aided by references or editing.

So, I lean they were not fully AI-generated. They may have used some references or guidelines, but the content shows adaptation to the problem context.
