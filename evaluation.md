| 1. Requirement coverage                         | 4     | Covers required features: private and group chat separation, public/group privacy via `groups.type`, delivery/status tables, group members table, and basic message distinction. Missing an explicit universal message table (they split group vs private), but functional coverage is present.                |
| 2. Modeling correctness & normalization         | 4     | Clear use of join table (`groupMembers`), separate status tables, and `groups` meta. However splitting `groupChats` and `privateChats` introduces schema duplication (same columns exist in two message tables) — acceptable but less DRY than a unified `conversation/message` model. FK usage looks correct. |
| 3. Scalability & performance                    | 3     | Notes mention replicas, partition-by-date, materialized views and connection pooling — good. Lacks a concrete partitioning/sharding plan, per-table indexing strategy, and handling for large fan-out in group message delivery (no explicit fan-out/denormalization approach).                                |
| 4. Status & temporal events                     | 4     | Delivery/status tables (`groupChatsStatus`, `privateChatsStatus`) and timestamps exist. That supports status transitions. Could be improved by clarifying per-recipient vs aggregate semantics and retention/compaction for high-write status tables.                                                          |
| 5. Security & multi-tenancy                     | 3     | Proposal includes JWT, TLS, rate limiting, and E2EE — good. No schema-level multi-tenant scoping or mention of row-level security, tenant_id fields, or signed URL handling for attachments. Key management details for E2EE are high-level (not mapped to schema).                                            |
| 6. Files / multimedia handling                  | 3     | Messages store media URLs and they recommend CDN; this is OK for a simple design. But there is no file_metadata table (no size/mime/versioning/thumbnail fields) and no signed URL/versioning discussion.                                                                                                      |
| 7. Group membership semantics & history         | 4     | `groupMembers` supports many-to-many and has `CreatedAt`/`UpdatedAt` and `IsAdmin`. Good. I could not see `joined_at`/`left_at` explicitly for message-visibility enforcement — that weakens the “no seeing messages before join” guarantee unless `CreatedAt` is used to imply join time.                     |
| 8. Public channels semantics                    | 3     | `groups.type` enum allows public/private classification. However schema does not enforce "everyone reads, only members post" at DB level (no ACL table). These policies appear to be left to application logic.                                                                                                |
| 9. Operational considerations / maintainability | 3     | They mention PgBouncer, replicas, CDN, monitoring, and queueing — good operational awareness. Missing specifics around migrations, partition maintenance, backfills, schema evolution, and automated rollback procedures.                                                                                      |
| 10. Clarity of notes & reasoning                | 4     | Notes are well-structured and justify SQL choice with examples (including a union query). Reasoning is pragmatic and focused. A few minor typos and some statements are generic, but overall readable and appropriate for a candidate-level design doc.                                                        |

I looked at both notes.md and proposal.md. My impression:

The writing is relatively clean and clear, but there are small imperfections, uneven depth, and occasional generic phrasing. That is consistent with human writing with some help or reference to existing patterns.

There is no obvious “smell” of full AI generation (e.g. overuse of very formal phrasing, repetitive structure, unusual phrasing). The content is specific to the assignment, uses domain-specific terms, and exhibits minor idiosyncrasies in expression.

Some paragraphs are quite general and could be templates, but overall, the documents seem plausible as human work, perhaps aided by references or editing.

So, I lean they were not fully AI-generated. They may have used some references or guidelines, but the content shows adaptation to the problem context.
